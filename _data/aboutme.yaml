        <p>
        After enduring the verbal beatdowns and helplessness that came with working part-time at a call center, I was determined to never let my work make anyone feel the way that the customers on the other end of the phone did ever again. I want my product to be a positive influence to those it comes into contact with, not a source of frustration and anger like the service this particular company provided.

        On the other hand, when deciding what field I wanted to study, I wanted something that would be able to utilize my analytical mindset and skills, while also being able to draw from my background in more creative pursuits like writing, music, and art. After giving it some thought, I felt that studying computer science and entering the programming space would help me fully utilize my skills and talents, setting me up for success.
        </p>
        <p>
        With these two goals driving my way forward, I decided to pursue front-end development, as it combines these two motivations together. In this space, I am able to work on what the user actually interacts with, directly impacting the quality of their experience. Further, while this space of course utilizes my abilities in programming and development, my other talents can also find places to shine, such as by influencing the design or user experience. Because of these opportunities, I believe that this field is one where I am able to flourish, able to provide the best of my abilities for both the users and my employers.

        Ever since I was a child, music has always been a large part of my life. I started learning the piano at a young age and eventually picked up the violin as well. Though I eventually switched from violin to trumpet, I continue to play both the piano and trumpet to this day.<br>
        <br>
        Besides music, I also enjoy trying to improve my skills in art and writing. For example, my interest in writing led me to become involved with MAL Rewrite, a volunteer organization on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a> that is dedicated to writing original, high quality synopses for all the entries on the site, which I now help lead as a coordinator. My contributions to the group can be seen <a href="https://mclee3360.github.io/rewrite-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

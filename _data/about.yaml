      <p>MAL Rewrite is a volunteer organization that serves MyAnimeList, one of the largest online databases and communities for East Asian media. Rewrite’s goal is to create original, high-quality synopses for every entry on the site, and when I was last part of the organization, the group had already uploaded over 4000 synopses.<p>
      <p>I initially served as a writer but quickly moved up to an editor position. After another year, I transitioned into a leadership role as a coordinator, which had me doing everything from giving final approval on synopses, managing member applications, writing scripts to automate administrative tasks, and coordinating with the site administrators to get the resources we needed.<p>
      <p>My time as part of this group served as a great way to develop my writing and editing skills, as well as give back to a site that I used quite a bit back in my younger days. It also served me in some unexpected ways, providing opportunities to develop my programming skills as well as meet some great friends.</p>

        Ever since I was a child, music has always been a large part of my life. I started learning the piano at a young age and eventually picked up the violin as well. Though I eventually switched from violin to trumpet, I continue to play both the piano and trumpet to this day.<br>
        <br>
        Besides music, I also enjoy trying to improve my skills in art and writing. For example, my interest in writing led me to become involved with MAL Rewrite, a volunteer organization on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a> that is dedicated to writing original, high quality synopses for all the entries on the site, which I now help lead as a coordinator. My contributions to the group can be seen <a href="https://mclee3360.github.io/rewrite-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
